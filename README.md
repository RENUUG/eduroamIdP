# RENUansible_eduroam
This is a copy of Chris Rohrer's hard work in creating ansible scripts for installing freeradius eduroam customized to fit RENU NREN member institutions

I do not own this content and I pay credit to the efforts done by Ubuntunet team to have the original scripts available. You can find the original repository at https://github.com/ubuntunet

Again, this repository was created to customise the original scripts to fit in with the Ugandan NREN as a separate project to help easily automate eduroam set up in Uganda.

If you have read and understood the above, either continue to README.mdown or you can visit this link for https://github.com/ubuntunet/eduroam_radius

Either way, good luck
